# The 2019 UChicago Scav Hunt

[The 2019 University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt List](http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/lists/2019.pdf)

## Items Completed With Code

- (80) Your team’s archaeologists uncovered an ancient civilization’s musical contraption, and using a
technological interface of your own, you’ve brought it to life! Your rhythm game-style interface
can use buttons, lights, circuitry, and any other wonders of our modern age to provide prompts
and feedback for your 1 to 2 minute song, but the actual sounds should all be produced using
physical parts of the contraption. Of course, just like in other rhythm games, missing prompts
will cause some of your corresponding sounds not to play. [225 points] † (Nick & Em)
- (257) Ugh, it can be so hard to read out those viral tweets when you have to put your phone down to
clap between each word. Make us an app that, as we speak into it, will automatically
insert a clap sound as we verbally spread these posts like wildfire. [Thirty nine points] (Nick) 

## Items Completed Physically

- (207) What is this, a ski lift for crudit´es? [What is this, 12 points?] (Nick)
- (280) With the constant dogpile of lab write-ups, Piazza discourses, and titillating cases of codegone-wild, our fair CMSC majors have every reason to Rage Against The Machine. After all,
those big blocks of scrap metal don’t belong in a night on the town—but with grading scales
like these, who can afford to leave work at home? Thankfully, your team’s top designers are
ready to bring us a new kind of “programming style”. Your contribution to haute couture,
apart from being beautifully designed, precisely tailored, and delicately manufactured, is also
a masterpiece of functionality. Elegantly incorporated keys and trackpads allow the wearer to
churn out code while chumming it up with the elites, while a coordinated accessory includes
a discrete screen for quick typo-checks in the powder room. Aside from taking a strut down
the runway, your model will be asked to demonstrate their range of motion and typing speed
with your garments. The runway show will take place in the Max Palevsky Cinema Lobby at
10:00 a.m. on Sunday, and then the Judges will examine your garment after Judgment. After
the runway show, please provide a clothes hanger—and your garment—to the Judges, who will
return it at Results. [175 points] † (Em)
