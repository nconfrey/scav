# The 2019 UChicago Scav Hunt

[The 2019 University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt List](http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/lists/2019.pdf)

## Items Completed With Code

- (80) Your team’s archaeologists uncovered an ancient civilization’s musical contraption, and using a
technological interface of your own, you’ve brought it to life! Your rhythm game-style interface
can use buttons, lights, circuitry, and any other wonders of our modern age to provide prompts
and feedback for your 1 to 2 minute song, but the actual sounds should all be produced using
physical parts of the contraption. Of course, just like in other rhythm games, missing prompts
will cause some of your corresponding sounds not to play. [225 points] † (Nick & Em)
- (257) Ugh, it can be so hard to read out those viral tweets when you have to put your phone down to
clap between each word. Make us an app that, as we speak into it, will automatically
insert a clap sound as we verbally spread these posts like wildfire. [Thirty nine points] (Nick)

## Items Completed Physically

- (203) A BarbieTM-esque doll that can dab. [5 points; 5 bonus points if it can do so with a pull string] (Emilee)
- (207) What is this, a ski lift for crudit´es? [What is this, 12 points?] (Nick)
