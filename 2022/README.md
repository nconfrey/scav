Our team, Sourdough: Young and Hot, participated as a virtual team this year.
Though the list was a truncated version of the full list, we still had a blast!

One interesting mechanic this year was that we ran on a different timescale (2014).
For example, if an item was due on February, 26, 2014 it was actually due on
Thursday, May 5th, 2022 at 2:00pm central time.

Em kicked the year off by creating the [Scavendates -> Normie Times](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bcfv5MNbsj1GqW5j5cwyHMW3lBpxZrm66EeZ_GCSpmY/edit#gid=1426070463) spreadsheet.
