Our team, Sourdough: Young and Hot, participated as a virtual team this year.
Though the list was a truncated version of the full list, we still had a blast!

One interesting mechanic this year was that we ran on a different timescale (2014).
For example, if an item was due on February, 26, 2014 it was actually due on
Thursday, May 5th, 2022 at 2:00pm central time.

Em kicked the year off by creating the [Scavendates -> Normie Times](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bcfv5MNbsj1GqW5j5cwyHMW3lBpxZrm66EeZ_GCSpmY/edit#gid=1426070463) spreadsheet.

## Items Completed With Code

- (33) Like the New York Times Spelling Bee, but wish it had a hard mode? Then you’ll love this Item. It will go live on National Puzzle Day at buzz.pythonanywhere.com. Feel free to use whatever resources
you’d like to complete it, and go fast! [10 points for making Queen Bee, 8/5/3 bonus points for 1st 2nd and 3rd to complete it] (Em + Nick)

## Items Completed Physically

- (1) A copy of the 2014(0) University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt List. [1 point]
- (8) Why, thank you for those heartfelt cards celebrating Penguin Awareness Day (January 20th), International Plastic Bag Free Day (July 3rd), Vanilla Cupcake Day (November 10th), or, frankly, any three mostly-phony holidays, emailed to virtualscavjudge@gmail.com on that holiday. [2 points each] (Em)
- (56) On June 1st, show up to any CVS. Go in, and buy precisely one (1) item and get a receipt. Pics (with
a tape measure for scale) or it didn’t happen. [1 point per inch] (Em & Nick) -- 38 inch receipt!!
- (66) It’s the RGB Code Guessing Game! The game where you guess a color’s RGB Code! Don’t you understand? To participate, meet in the Virtual Scav Zoom Room on Saint Patrick’s Day. [#000005 points]
