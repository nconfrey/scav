Our team, Sourdough: Young and Hot, participated as a virtual team this year.
Though the list was a truncated version of the full list, we still had a blast!

One interesting mechanic this year was that we ran on a different timescale (2014).
For example, if an item was due on February, 26, 2014 it was actually due on
Thursday, May 5th, 2022 at 2:00pm central time.

Em kicked the year off by creating the [Scavendates -> Normie Times](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bcfv5MNbsj1GqW5j5cwyHMW3lBpxZrm66EeZ_GCSpmY/edit#gid=1426070463) spreadsheet.

## Items Completed With Code

- (11) For those of you who keep too many tabs open (you know who you are): A Chrome or Firefox extension that both every-so-often and on demand closes a tab randomly. [Either F1ref0x or Chr10me points, take your pick] (Em) -- [code](./11_close_my_tabs)
- (13)  A Congreve clock that displays the time. Your completion may be largely electronic, but it must fundamentally be controlled by a ball repeatedly rolling down a reversible plane. [70 o’clock points] (Nick) -- coding language: LEGO BOOST
- (33) Like the New York Times Spelling Bee, but wish it had a hard mode? Then you’ll love this Item. It will go live on National Puzzle Day at buzz.pythonanywhere.com. Feel free to use whatever resources you’d like to complete it, and go fast! [10 points for making Queen Bee, 8/5/3 bonus points for 1st 2nd and 3rd to complete it] (Em + Nick) -- [code & explanation](./33_bumblewords)
- (196) whattimeisitrightnow.scav. [6 points] (Em) -- [code & demo](./196_whattimeisitrightnow.scav)

Have up to four teammates show up just before September 5th begins in the Virtual Scav Zoom Room where they’ll get to experience this classic Uo fC tradition. [π points] (Everyone!) -- Scav in scav ;D
- (34) We just LOVE adding unnecessary difficulty to classic newspaper games, so how about. . . Verbal Wordle? It’s exactly as it sounds.
