## Requirements

Note: This should have requirements in a virtualenv but it's scav, so ain't nobody got time for that.

## Raspberry Pi

### Hardware & OS

We used a Raspberry Pi 3 for this project running Raspbian Stretch version 4.14 release date 2018-04-18. Downloaded from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/, but you may need to find this in an archive somewhere.

Install the OS, we flashed the microsd card using [Etcher](https://etcher.io/).

### Video Player

package: `python-omxplayer-wrapper`

```
# Prereqs
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y libdbus-1{,-dev}

# Install the package
pip3 install omxplayer-wrapper
```

(Or follow the installation instructions here: http://python-omxplayer-wrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Gotchas:

- The OMXPlayer wrapper can only have one video per instance as per https://github.com/willprice/python-omxplayer-wrapper/issues/73 thus we work around this by concatenating all of our videos together and simply seekingto play different snippets.
