# Read lirc output, in order to sense key presses on an IR remote.
# There are various Python packages that claim to do this but
# they tend to require elaborate setup and I couldn't get any to work.
# This approach requires a lircd.conf but does not require a lircrc.
# If irw works, then in theory, this should too.
# Based on irw.c, https://github.com/aldebaran/lirc/blob/master/tools/irw.c
