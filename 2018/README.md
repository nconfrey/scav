Here's [a link to the full list](http://scavhunt.uchicago.edu/2018List.pdf)

### Items Completed With Code
* 175 Passively watching Saturday morning cartoons is fun, but actively interacting with them would be
even better! Your laser-based technology should allow a Judge to use a TV remote to interact with
elements of a scene from any classic television cartoon. At least one of these elements should be moving
within the scene, and at least two elements should trigger special effects (such as movement or sound)
after being clicked. Zip zap! [150 points] †
* 182. A working replica of Solomon's Throne, lavishly decorated with a minimum of three stairs. Each and
every time a designated ruler ascends, the mechanical animals on either side move to aid each successive
stair. As they take their seat, a crown is lowered to rest gently upon their head. [225 points] †

### Items Completed Physically 
* 10 The Avocado Pit and the Pendulum. A swinging rejection stamp pulled down certainly, relentlessly
down towards a home loan application with the addition of each avocado pit to the mechanism. The
process is calibrated to reject the loan at a precise number of pits (or equivalent weight). In turn,
this is the number of avocados the applicant could buy with the money in their checking account. [28

* 114 We all know that Hyde Park has not only a big cat problem, but a big witch problem as well. Good
thing Kattenstoet is the same day as Judgment this year! Help us start our celebration by erecting and
parading a large towering cat in the style of the Belgian statues on the Quad at 2:30 p.m. on Friday.

* 128 Make our Mongol ancestors proud by displaying a bow that can both shoot an arrow and play a
wonderful tune on a fiddle. Violin will be provided. [23 points] (Em)
